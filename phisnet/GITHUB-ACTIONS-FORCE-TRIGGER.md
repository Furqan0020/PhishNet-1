# üöÄ GitHub Actions Force Trigger

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-22 17:35:00 UTC

## Purpose
This file is designed to force trigger GitHub Actions workflows by pushing changes to both `main` and `develop` branches.

## Workflow Status Check
If you can see this file on GitHub but workflows are not showing in the Actions tab, there may be an issue with:

1. **Repository Settings** - Actions may be disabled
2. **Workflow File Issues** - Syntax errors preventing workflow recognition
3. **Permissions** - Repository may lack proper permissions

## Expected Workflows to Trigger
- ‚úÖ comprehensive-testing.yml
- ‚úÖ enhanced-quality-gates.yml  
- ‚úÖ security-scanning.yml
- ‚úÖ branch-protection-monitor.yml
- ‚úÖ test-sdlc-workflow.yml
- ‚úÖ zero-trust-ci.yml

## Force Trigger Attempt: #4
Previous attempts:
1. Initial workflow deployment
2. Empty file fix + manual trigger
3. Test workflow creation + push
4. **Current: Documentation fix + .github folder commit** ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE

## Next Steps if Workflows Still Don't Appear
1. Check repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
3. Verify workflow files have no syntax errors
4. Manual trigger via GitHub web interface

**üî¥ CRITICAL:** If workflows are still not visible after this push, there's likely a repository configuration issue.
