# ðŸš€ PhishNet GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization Plan

## ðŸ“Š Current Status
- **GitHub Free Tier**: 2,000 minutes/month
- **Usage Goal**: Stay under 1,500 minutes/month (75% threshold)
- **Total Workflows**: 25+ workflows implemented

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Strategy

### 1. **Trigger Optimization**
- Reduce automatic triggers on push/PR
- Use `workflow_dispatch` for manual execution
- Implement conditional execution based on file changes
- Use scheduled jobs sparingly

### 2. **Workflow Consolidation**
- Combine related workflows
- Use matrix builds for efficiency
- Implement job dependencies to reduce parallel execution

### 3. **Resource Optimization**
- Use job conditions to skip unnecessary runs
- Implement early termination for failed dependencies
- Cache optimization for faster builds

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow Categories & Optimization

### **Core Development Workflows** (Essential - Keep Optimized)
1. **CI Pipeline** - Only on main/develop branch changes
2. **Quality Gates** - Only on PR to main
3. **Security Scanning** - Weekly + PR to main
4. **Deployment** - Only on releases/tags

### **Monitoring Workflows** (Reduce Frequency)
1. **Branch Protection** - Weekly instead of daily
2. **Compliance Monitoring** - Monthly instead of weekly
3. **Access Review** - Monthly instead of weekly

### **Development Workflows** (Manual Trigger Only)
1. **Comprehensive Testing** - Manual trigger only
2. **Performance Testing** - Manual trigger only
3. **Multi-Stage Build** - Manual trigger only

### **Administrative Workflows** (Minimal/Manual)
1. **Secret Rotation** - Quarterly manual
2. **Disaster Recovery** - Manual only
3. **Environment Protection** - Manual only

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Optimization (Immediate)
- [ ] Remove duplicate workflows in phisnet/.github/workflows
- [ ] Optimize CI/CD triggers
- [ ] Consolidate security workflows
- [ ] Implement path-based conditions

### Phase 2: Schedule Optimization
- [ ] Reduce cron job frequency
- [ ] Implement smart scheduling
- [ ] Add manual triggers for non-critical workflows

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization
- [ ] Implement conditional workflow execution
- [ ] Add early termination conditions
- [ ] Optimize build caching

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results
- **Estimated Monthly Usage**: 800-1200 minutes (60% reduction)
- **Maintained Functionality**: 100% core features preserved
- **Manual Control**: Ability to run comprehensive checks when needed
