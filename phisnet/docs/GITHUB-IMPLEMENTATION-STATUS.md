## 🔍 **Verification Instructions**

### **1. Check GitHub Repository:**
Visit: `https://github.com/gh0st-bit/PhishNet`
- **Branches Tab:** Should show 6 branches
- **Code Tab:** Should show recent commits and workflow files
- **Settings → Branches:** Should show protection rules

### **2. Check GitHub Actions:**
Visit: `https://github.com/gh0st-bit/PhishNet/actions`
- **Actions Tab:** Should show recent workflow runs
- **Workflow Runs:** Should see runs triggered by recent pushes
- **Workflow Files:** Should list all 17 workflow files

### **3. Check Specific Workflows:**
- **Latest Push to Develop:** Should trigger 3+ workflows
- **Workflow Status:** Check for success/failure status
- **Workflow Logs:** Review execution details

### **4. Manual Workflow Trigger Test:**
```bash
# Go to GitHub Actions → Select any workflow → Run workflow
# This tests the workflow_dispatch trigger functionality
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If You Don't See GitHub Actions:**

#### **1. Check Repository Settings:**
```
Settings → Actions → General
- Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
- Ensure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled
```

#### **2. Check Workflow File Syntax:**
All workflow files are properly formatted YAML with correct:
- `name:` field
- `on:` triggers  
- `jobs:` definition
- Proper indentation

#### **3. Force Trigger Workflows:**
```bash
# Create a simple change to trigger workflows
git checkout develop
echo "Force trigger $(date)" >> WORKFLOW-TRIGGER-TEST.md
git add WORKFLOW-TRIGGER-TEST.md
git commit -m "Force trigger workflows"
git push origin develop
```

#### **4. Check Branch Names:**
Workflows are configured to trigger on:
- `main` branch (production workflows)
- `develop` branch (development workflows)
- Pull requests to these branches
