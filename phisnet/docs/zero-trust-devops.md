# 🔐 PhishNet Zero Trust DevOps Strategy

## 🎯 Overview

PhishNet implements a **Zero Trust DevOps model** where no developer has unrestricted access to the entire codebase. This ensures security, maintains code quality, and enforces separation of concerns across our multi-module architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Access Control

### Module Structure
```

## 🔐 Zero Trust Principles

### 1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- Developers only access modules they work on
- No blanket repository access
- Time-limited access for integration work

### 2. **Mandatory Peer Review**
- All changes require team member approval
- Cross-module changes require multiple team approvals
- Security-sensitive code requires security team review

### 3. **Continuous Verification**
- Every commit triggers security scans
- Access permissions verified on each push
- Multi-tenancy isolation tested automatically

### 4. **Audit Everything**
- All access attempts logged
- Change tracking with detailed attribution
- Security events monitored and alerted

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Security

### Pipeline Stages

    A[Code Push] --> B[Security Scan]
    B --> C[Access Control Check]
    C --> D[Module Detection]
    D --> E[Parallel Module CI]
    E --> F[Integration Tests]
    F --> G[Security Validation]
    G --> H[Deployment]
```

### Security Gates

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Secret detection
   - Code formatting
   - Basic lint checks

2. **Push-time Validation**
   - Access control verification
   - File permission checks
   - Branch protection enforcement

3. **CI Pipeline Security**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Static code analysis
   - License compliance checking

4. **Integration Security**
   - API contract validation
   - Multi-tenancy testing
   - Cross-module security verification

5. **Deployment Security**
   - Environment validation
   - Deployment approval workflows
   - Rollback capability verification

## 👥 Team Collaboration

### Frontend Team Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/frontend/new-dashboard

# 2. Work only in allowed directories
# ✅ Allowed: client/, shared/types/
# ❌ Forbidden: server/, migrations/

# 3. Commit changes
git add client/src/pages/dashboard/
git commit -m "feat: add campaign dashboard"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/frontend/new-dashboard

# 5. Request review from frontend team
# Auto-assigned via CODEOWNERS
```

### Backend Team Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/backend/email-service

# 2. Work only in allowed directories  
# ✅ Allowed: server/, shared/schema.ts, shared/types/
# ❌ Forbidden: client/ (except for API contracts)

# 3. Implement with security focus
# - Validate organizationId isolation
# - Implement proper input validation
# - Add comprehensive logging

# 4. Cross-module integration
# For API changes affecting frontend:
# - Update shared/types/ for TypeScript contracts
# - Coordinate with frontend team for integration
# - Request frontend team review for API contracts
```

### Database Team Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create migration branch
git checkout -b feature/database/audit-logging

# 2. Work in allowed directories
# ✅ Allowed: migrations/, shared/schema.ts
# ❌ Forbidden: client/, server/ implementation

# 3. Create migration with security focus
# - Maintain multi-tenancy (organizationId foreign keys)
# - Add proper indexes for performance
# - Include rollback procedures

# 4. Schema updates
# Update shared/schema.ts
# Coordinate with backend team for implementation
# Request review from both database and backend teams
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Individual Developer Environment

```bash
# 1. Clone with limited scope (if possible)
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/gh0st-bit/PhishNet.git

# 2. Setup module-specific environment
cd PhishNet/phisnet

# Frontend developers
cd client && npm install
npm run dev  # Frontend only

# Backend developers  
cd server && npm install
npm run dev  # Backend only

# Full environment (for integration work)
npm run dev:all  # Requires approval
```

### Access Request Process

```bash
# Request additional module access
git checkout -b access-request/backend-integration
echo "Requesting backend access for API integration" > ACCESS_REQUEST.md
git add ACCESS_REQUEST.md
git commit -m "request: temporary backend access for API integration"
git push origin access-request/backend-integration

# Create PR with justification
# Team lead reviews and grants temporary access
# Access automatically revoked after merge
```

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

### Access Violation Detection

```bash
# Automated alerts for:
# 1. Unauthorized file modifications
# 2. Cross-module access without approval
# 3. Security-sensitive code changes without security review
# 4. Direct pushes to protected branches

# Incident response:
# 1. Immediate access revocation
# 2. Change rollback if necessary  
# 3. Security team investigation
# 4. Process improvement recommendations
```

### Emergency Procedures

```bash
# Critical security hotfix
git checkout -b hotfix/security/critical-vulnerability

# Emergency override process:
# 1. Admin approval required
# 2. Immediate security team notification
# 3. Expedited review process
# 4. Post-incident analysis mandatory
```
