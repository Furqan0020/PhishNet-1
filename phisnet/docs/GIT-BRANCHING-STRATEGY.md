# Git Branching Strategy & SDLC Workflow

## 📋 Branch Structure Overview

Our repository follows **GitFlow** branching strategy with enterprise-grade SDLC practices:

### 🌳 **Branch Hierarchy**

```
main (production)
├── release/* (release preparation)
├── develop (integration)
│   ├── feature/* (new features)
│   └── bugfix/* (bug fixes)
├── staging (pre-production testing)
└── hotfix/* (emergency fixes)
```

## 🔄 **SDLC Workflow Process**

### **Development Workflow**
```
1. Developer creates feature branch from develop
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature

2. Development and testing on feature branch
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
   git push origin feature/new-feature

3. Create Pull Request to develop
   - Triggers: comprehensive-testing.yml
   - Triggers: enhanced-quality-gates.yml
   - Requires: Code review + status checks

4. Merge to develop (triggers integration tests)
   - Triggers: security-scanning.yml
   - Auto-deploy to development environment

5. Create Pull Request from develop to staging
   - Triggers: All quality workflows
   - Requires: QA approval

6. Staging testing and validation
   - Manual/automated testing
   - Performance validation
   - Security verification

7. Create Pull Request from staging to main
   - Triggers: All compliance workflows
   - Requires: 2+ approvals
   - Final security and compliance checks

8. Production deployment
   - Triggers: deployment-automation.yml
   - Creates release tag
   - Monitors deployment health
```

## 🎯 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Check Branches on GitHub:**
Visit: `https://github.com/gh0st-bit/PhishNet/branches`
- Should see: main, develop, staging, release, feature/sdlc-implementation, hotfix/security-patches (6 total branches)

### **2. Check GitHub Actions:**
Visit: `https://github.com/gh0st-bit/PhishNet/actions`
- Should see: Recent workflow runs triggered by pushes
- Should see: Workflow files listed in Actions tab

### **3. Check Branch Protection:**
Visit: `https://github.com/gh0st-bit/PhishNet/settings/branches`
- Should see: Branch protection rules for main and develop

### **4. Test Workflow Trigger:**
```bash
# Create a test commit to trigger workflows
git checkout develop
echo "Test commit" > test-trigger.txt
git add test-trigger.txt
git commit -m "test: trigger workflows"
git push origin develop
```

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting GitHub Actions**

### **If Workflows Don't Appear:**
1. **Check File Paths:** Ensure `.github/workflows/` directory exists
2. **Check YAML Syntax:** Validate workflow file syntax
3. **Check Permissions:** Ensure repository has Actions enabled
4. **Check Triggers:** Verify push/PR events match branch patterns

### **Common Issues:**
- **Workflow files in wrong location:** Must be in `.github/workflows/`
- **YAML syntax errors:** Use GitHub's workflow validator
- **Missing permissions:** Check repository Actions settings
- **Branch name mismatches:** Verify trigger branch patterns

---

## 📈 **Expected GitHub Activity**

After implementation, you should see:

### **In GitHub Repository:**
1. **6 new branches** created and visible
2. **16+ workflow files** in `.github/workflows/`
3. **Branch protection rules** applied to main/develop
4. **Actions tab** showing recent workflow runs

### **In GitHub Actions:**
1. **Workflow runs** triggered by recent pushes
2. **Status badges** for each workflow
3. **Deployment environments** (staging, production)
4. **Security alerts** and compliance reports

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Verify branch structure** on GitHub
2. **Check Actions tab** for workflow execution
3. **Create test PR** to trigger workflows
4. **Monitor security/compliance dashboards**

*This branching strategy ensures enterprise-grade SDLC with proper separation of concerns, automated testing, security validation, and compliance monitoring across all development stages.*
