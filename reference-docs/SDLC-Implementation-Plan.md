# 🎯 Complete SDLC Implementation Plan

## 📋 **Project Overview**
- **Repository**: gh0st-bit/PhishNet  
- **Project**: Cybersecurity Training Platform
- **Goal**: Complete error-free SDLC implementation
- **Status**: Fixing workflow location issues

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Issue**: Workflows located in `phisnet/.github/workflows/` 
- **Required**: Workflows must be in `.github/workflows/` (repository root)
- **Solution**: Move all workflows to correct location using GitHub MCP

## 📁 **Repository Structure Issue**
```
PhishNet/
├── .github/workflows/           ← REQUIRED (GitHub Actions)
├── phisnet/                     ← Application directory
│   ├── .github/workflows/       ← WRONG LOCATION (current)
│   ├── client/
│   ├── server/
│   └── ...
└── Documentation/
```

## 🚀 **SDLC Implementation Phases**

### Phase 1: Repository Restructure ✅
- Move workflows to correct location
- Maintain application in phisnet/ subdirectory
- Ensure workflows can access application code

### Phase 2: Core CI/CD Pipeline (0% → 30%)
- ✅ Basic testing workflow
- ✅ Build pipeline
- ✅ Quality gates
- ✅ Security scanning

### Phase 3: Advanced Workflows (30% → 60%)
- ✅ Deployment automation
- ✅ Compliance monitoring
- ✅ Performance testing
- ✅ Security orchestration

### Phase 4: Production Features (60% → 80%)
- ✅ Multi-environment support
- ✅ Rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Monitoring integration
- ✅ Disaster recovery

### Phase 5: Complete SDLC (80% → 100%)
- ✅ Documentation automation
- ✅ Reporting dashboards
- ✅ Stakeholder notifications
- ✅ Maintenance procedures

## 📊 **Success Criteria**
1. All workflows visible in GitHub Actions tab
2. Automatic triggers working on push/PR
3. No broken builds or failed workflows
4. Complete test coverage
5. Production-ready deployment pipeline

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. Create workflows at repository root
2. Test each workflow individually  
3. Ensure application paths are correct
4. Validate complete SDLC functionality
